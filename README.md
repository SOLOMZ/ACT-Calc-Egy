# ACT-Calc-Egy ðŸ“‡
simple program coded in C that averages ACT score (without including the science section) and translates it to SAT score, and it calculates the egyptian "tansiq" score.

# Installation
## Linux and MacOS:
open the terminal and run the file (ex: `./FILENAME`) or compile it from source (ex: `gcc calc.c`)
## Windows:
if windows throws an error like *"Access Denied"*, put the `.exe` file in a folder and open windows defender and add it in the exclusion list
and if you are gonna compile it from source, compile `calcwindows.c` instead of `calc.c`
